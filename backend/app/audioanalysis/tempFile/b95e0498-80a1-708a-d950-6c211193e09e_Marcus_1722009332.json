    "Note accuracy": "100%",
    "Velocity accuracy": "moderate",
    "Duration accuracy": "outstanding",
    "Comment": "Your performance was very accurate in terms of hitting the correct notes. There were no extra, missing, or wrong notes, which is excellent. However, there is room for improvement in the velocity and duration of the notes.",
    "Errors": "No errors were detected in terms of extra, missing, or wrong notes.",
    "Detailed_Feedback": "You have successfully played all the notes correctly, which is commendable. Your note accuracy is perfect. The velocity of your notes was slightly inconsistent compared to the standard performance, which affected the overall dynamics of the piece. The duration of your notes was very close to the standard, showing good control over note lengths.",
    "Recommendations": "To improve further, focus on maintaining consistent velocity for each note to match the dynamics of the standard performance. Practice playing with a metronome to ensure that the duration of each note is precise. Keep up the good work!"
